HOW TO SET UP:
Extract the zip to any folder.
Right click: fps unlocker.exe
Hover over "Send to"
Select "Desktop (create shortcut)"
Rename the shortcut to anything you want.

FEATURES:
fps unlocker (of course)
customize your cursor icons, and easily replace them when they get deleted from a roblox update
customize your oof sound, either bring back oof or put anything you want.

why you should use an fps unlocker even if your monitor is only 60 hz:
roblox is completely parallel with vsync, instead uses their own janky method of preventing screen tearing,
which can actually make it look like you have LESS fps than you actually do.
the solution to this is having more fps so if by default on roblox visually you'd have 10% less fps, then that
means 66 fps already fixed all your problems. (actually i have no idea what im talking about but it does look smoother)
another (good) side-effect of using fps unlockers is that they fix input delay

another thing you may consider:
sometimes roblox developers bind events to your refresh rate, which means if you have 300 fps instead of 60,
their specific code will be ran 300 times instead of 60 times. this could either be good or bad, however usually
it doesnt affect anything. adding x * deltatime * 60 to the code usually fixes this as well.
if you dont know what any of that means dont worry about it, as a note for devs.

BYFRON/ANTICHEAT:
this program does not do any injections, instead just automates the pain of you creating a .json file inside
ClientSettings which you can do yourself, it's just a bit annoying after the 50th time.
My point is you are not getting banned for using this.

UNINSTALLING:
this program does not install itself anywhere, thus why you had to create the shortcut yourself.
so that means, to delete this, all you have to do is just delete the folder you installed it into.
if you accidentally forgot where you installed the folder to, right click the icon on desktop, then click
"Open file location", and you're free to delete everything there.
